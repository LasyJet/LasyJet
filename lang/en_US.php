<p>If there's more than one way to do a job, and one of those ways will result in disaster, then somebody will do it that way.</p>
<p>According to Robert Murphy (son of Edward A. Murphy, Jr.) his father's statement was along these lines; reported in People (31 January 1983), p. 82; alternately reported as \"If there is a wrong way to do something, then someone will do it\"</p>

<p>Murphy's Quantum Law: Anything that can, could have, or will go wrong, is going wrong, all at once.</p>
<p>With diligent effort he has established that there is no statistical basis for Murphy’s Law. He has also established that he believes in it anyway.</p>";
